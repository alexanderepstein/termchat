## What's Special
There are a few things that is awesome about this project and [hack.chat](hack.chat) in general the first is they are both open source!

* Open source is love.

* [hack.chat](hack.chat) already never holds onto these chats unlike other services such as Skype as soon as all parties leave the chat all chat history is never again obtainable

* No one needs to sign up for an account, which is always a plus!

* Can be used from the terminal, so no web browser is necessary!

* By utilizing a client to interact with hack.chat we can add things like encryption (soon to come)

* Python and the curses interface go together like two peas in a pod

## Dependencies
  * Python 3
  * websocket-client

## Todo
  - [ ] Add end to end encryption
  - [ ] Check for an active connection status before starting the application
  - [ ] Check if message went through and the ip hasn't been rate limited
  - [ ] If user has left add a message to the chat from System with this info

## Special Thanks

#### Hack.chat
Without the hack.chat [project](https://github.com/AndrewBelt/hack.chat) by [AndrewBelt](https://github.com/AndrewBelt) deployed [here](hack.chat) this project would have been a lot more complicated as most of the heavy lifting is done by it.

#### Hackchat Chatbot Library
The Hchat.py file was largely based on [this project](https://github.com/gkbrk/hackchat/blob/master/hackchat.py) by [gkbrk](https://github.com/gkbrk) which was modified so that it could be used without the need for a bot.

#### Interface
The interface in this project was largely based on [this project](https://github.com/mathiasbc/slacky) by [mathiasbc](https://github.com/mathiasbc) which was modified to integrate with the hackchat library rather than the slack client.

##### Check out these projects because without them this would not have been possible :tada:
